I am a neuroscientist exploring the world of psychiatry, specifically mood and impulsive-compulsive disorders, to identify quantifiable bio-markers and propose mechanism-based solutions. With training in both computational and experimental approaches, The lab utilises stimulation-based approaches to probe and modulate brain networks to alter neural activity and corresponding behaviours. Supplementing the above approach, mathematical models (data-driven and computational) are developed to understand the findings better.

My research interests broadly fall into the following categories. 


## Diagnostic theme

This theme of work focused on estimating and detecting markers from behaviours or/and neural data in health and disease. These identified markers could be of behavioural/neural origin or computational markers.


## Neuro-modulation Theme

Using multi-modal stimulation (invasive and non-invasive) protocols, the underlying neural activity is targeted to modulate behaviour in compulsive disorders such as addiction, Obsessive Compulsive disorder. 


I am a lecturer at the Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield and head the Cognitive Computational Neuropsychiatry lab (CCnP). Please reach me at a.mandali@sheffield.ac.uk to chat about my work or if you would work with us.
